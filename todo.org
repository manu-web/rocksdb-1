* Support recovery from WOTR log [0/4]
** TODO Insert key containing head of log when a memtable is made immutable
** TODO Write a test using WOTR which fails to recover data
** TODO Verify that the head of the log is correct using the test
** TODO Implement WOTR recovery
Look at DBImpl::RecoverLogFiles() in particular.

Perhaps the recovery procedure is run when WOTR is initialized? That means the initialization procedure will need to take an argument to enable or disable recovery (we don't want KV-LSM to try to recover from the valuelog).
